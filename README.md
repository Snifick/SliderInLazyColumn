# SliderInLazyColumn
The example of slider in LazyColumn
The slider is located on the right side of the screen and shows how much you scrolled the page.

### Additionally, only the context and key is required

### The composition tree looks lite, recompositon only the slider.

## Attention!
This is just a light example, and it needs to be refined for certain needs. But in some cases it will work perfectly.
## Main problem:
This requests the UI-Thread for a while, so there is a freeze at the beginning, but remember that the idea is open for improvements :)
